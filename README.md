## Task 

We were asked to show in a list the most 5 valued restaurants in Palma. 
The exercise has been done with the information taken from the web page "TripAdvisor", that information was put into an array and shown in the screen with a function that generates a card containing the information for each restaurant.

In this version we have included a searchbar that orders the restaurants in three ways: ascending, descending or random.
Also, the function was put in an external file called "functions.php", which is refered in the main document so we can get its content.

Since this page is a parody I added some of the worst comments I found on TripAdvisor to the restaurants I chose.
This web page shouldn't be taken seriously.

## Requirements

To see the page in the correct way we will need a web navigator,  and an Apache server since the page is written in PHP.

### PHP

PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development.
Fast, flexible and pragmatic, PHP powers everything from your blog to the most popular websites in the world.

It requires an Apacher server in order to be played in a web navigator correctly


### Apache server

We will be getting our Apacher server from the application XAMPP, that also includes another servers, so we can continue using it in the future

XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages. Since most actual web server deployments use the same components as XAMPP, it makes transitioning from a local test server to a live server possible.
